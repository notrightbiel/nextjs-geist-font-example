# Detailed Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup and File Creation
- **Files to Create:**  
  - Create three new files in the project root (or in a dedicated folder) named `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.  
- **Context:**  
  - These files form a standalone, minimalistic site for managing weekly commitments, independent of the existing Next.js and other files.

## 2. index.html
**Purpose:** Define the site’s structure and user interface.  
**Changes/Steps:**
- Add the HTML5 doctype and meta tags (charset and viewport) at the top.
- Link the external CSS file (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`) in the `<head>`.
- Include the external JavaScript file (`<script src="script.js" defer></script>`) before the closing `</body>` tag.
- Create a main header with an `<h1>` element titled “Agenda Semanal”.
- Build a container that displays each day of the week:
  - For each day (e.g., "Segunda-feira", "Terça-feira", etc.), add a `<section class="day" data-day="...">` containing an `<h2>` for the day name and an empty `<ul>` that will hold commitment items.
- Add a form with an id `addCommitmentForm`:
  - Include a `<select>` element listing the days of the week.
  - Include an `<input type="text">` for the "Hora" (time) and another `<input type="text">` for "Descrição" (commitment details).
  - Add a submit `<button>` (e.g., “Adicionar Compromisso”).
  - Insert a small `<div>` or `<span>` to display validation error messages if inputs are missing.

## 3. style.css
**Purpose:** Provide a minimalist, retro/nostalgic, yet modern and intuitive UI.  
**Changes/Steps:**
- Set the body’s base styles:
  - Use a retro-inspired font such as “Courier New” or default monospace.
  - Define background color (e.g., light gray or subtle pastel) and text color for readability.
- Layout:
  - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to arrange the day sections in a neat grid with consistent spacing, borders, and padding.
  - Style each `.day` section with retro borders (dotted or dashed) and subtle drop-shadows.
- Form styling:
  - Apply a consistent style for the `<select>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements using background colors, borders, and hover transitions.
  - Ensure the button has a clear call-to-action with retro-styled accents.
- Responsiveness:
  - Incorporate media queries so that the layout adjusts gracefully on smaller screens (e.g., stack days vertically on mobile).

## 4. script.js
**Purpose:** Enable dynamic functionality for adding and removing commitments.  
**Changes/Steps:**
- On DOMContentLoaded, select the form (`#addCommitmentForm`) and attach a submit event listener.
- In the event handler:
  - Prevent the default form submission.
  - Retrieve values for the selected day, time, and commitment description.
  - Validate inputs to ensure none are empty; if invalid, display an error message in the designated error element.
  - Identify the appropriate `<ul>` element within the corresponding day section (using the day’s data attribute).
  - Create a new `<li>` element that includes:
    - The commitment details (formatted as "Hora – Descrição").
    - A remove button (e.g., a simple "X" text button) appended to the `<li>`.
  - Attach an event listener to the remove button to allow deleting the commitment when clicked.
  - Clear input fields after successful addition.
- Implement error handling (try-catch) to manage any unexpected failures during DOM manipulation.

## 5. Integration and Testing
- **Integration:**  
  - This standalone site does not interfere with the existing Next.js files; it functions separately as a static scheduling page.
- **Testing:**  
  - Open `index.html` in a browser to check that the retro, nostalgic UI appears as expected.
  - Test form submission with valid and empty inputs to confirm error messages appear appropriately.
  - Validate that added commitments appear under the designated day and that clicking the remove ("X") button deletes them accordingly.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Use semantic HTML, clear form labeling, and proper error messaging.
  - Ensure smooth transitions and responsive design adjustments.

# Summary
- Created three standalone files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) for a weekly schedule organizer.  
- The HTML provides a semantic structure with day sections and a form to add commitments.  
- The CSS ensures a minimalist yet retro UI with modern typography, spacing, and responsive design.  
- The JS enables dynamic commitment addition and removal with robust input validation and error handling.  
- Testing involves verifying UI integrity, form validation, and interactive functionality.  
- The approach ensures easy code modification for updating schedules.
